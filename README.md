# Q-Learning-Ludo
This project is made in the course AI2 at Southern Danish University.

It uses the [ludopy](https://github.com/SimonLBSoerensen/LUDOpy) to simulate the game.

The QLerning.py is a file/class to train an agent.

The QLerningPlayer is to load a QTable and evaluate it playing against players that do random moves.
